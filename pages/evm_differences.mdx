# EVM Differences

Abstract is based on zkSync's zkStack VM which is EVM compatible, but not EVM equivalent.
This means that most smart contracts will work out of the box on Abstract, but there are cases where contracts may need to be rewritten.
This page details the various differences between Abstract's VM and the standard EVM.

## EVM Instructions

There are several instructions in Abstract's VM that function differently from the standard EVM.
This list includes `CREATE`, `CREATE2`, `CALL`, `STATICCALL`, and `DELEGATECALL`.
You can find the full list and an explanation of each difference in these [docs](https://docs.zksync.io/build/developer-reference/ethereum-differences/evm-instructions).

## Nonces

In Ethereum, nonces prevent replay attacks, ensure transaction order, and are used in address derivation for externally owned accounts (EOAs).
For smart contracts, nonces primarily determine the deployment address via create or create2 functions and can increase multiple times within a transaction.

Abstract, meanwhile, has native account abstraction which utilizes two types of nonces: a transaction nonce for validation and a deployment nonce for contract creation.
This separaration of nonces allows accounts to send many transactions by following only one nonce value and allows contracts to deploy many other contracts without conflicting with the transaction nonce.

A full explanation of the nonce differences between Abstract and Ethereum can be found [here](https://docs.zksync.io/build/developer-reference/ethereum-differences/nonces).

## Precompiles

Some EVM cryptographic precompiles (notably pairings and RSA) aren't currently available. However, pairing is
prioritized to allow deployment of both ZK chains and protocols like Aztec/Dark Forest without modifications.

Ethereum cryptographic primitives like `ecrecover`, `keccak256`, `sha256`, `ecadd` and `ecmul` are supported as precompiles.
No actions are required from your side as all the calls to the precompiles are done by the compilers under the hood.

It's important to be aware that the gas costs and behaviors of these precompiles when invoked via delegatecall may differ from those on Ethereum.

## Account Abstraction (AA)

The native account abstraction of Abstract and Ethereum's EIP 4337 aim to enhance
accounts' flexibility and user experience, but they differ in critical aspects listed below:

1. **Implementation Level**: Abstract's account abstraction is integrated at the
protocol level; however, EIP 4337 avoids the implementation at the protocol level.
2. **Account Types**: on Abstract, smart contract accounts and paymasters are
first-class citizens. Under the hood, all accounts (even EOAs) behave like smart
contract accounts; **all accounts support paymasters**.
3. **Transaction Processing**: EIP 4337 introduces a separate transaction flow for
smart contract accounts, which relies on a separate mempool for user operations, and
Bundlers - nodes that bundle user operations and sends them to be processed by the
EntryPoint contract, resulting in two separate transaction flows. In contrast, on
Abstract there is a unified mempool for transactions from both Externally Owned
Accounts (EOAs) and smart contract accounts. On Abstract, the Operator takes on
the role of bundling transactions, irrespective of the account type, and sends them
to the Bootloader (similar to the EntryPoint contract), which results in a single
mempool and transaction flow.
4. **Paymasters support**: Abstract allows both EOAs and smart contract accounts
to benefit from paymasters thanks to its single transaction flow. On the other hand,
EIP 4337 does not support paymasters for EOAs because paymasters are only
implemented in the new transaction flow for smart contract accounts.
