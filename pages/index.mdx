# Introducing Abstract

Abstract is an Ethereum L2 designed for consumer facing applications across DeFi, SocialFi, NFTs, and more. Abstract is EVM-compatible and supports all existing Ethereum tooling, including MetaMask, Foundry, Hardhat and others.

## Why Abstract?

Abstract is a Layer 2 ZK rollup built on top of Ethereum using the [ZK Stack](https://docs.zksync.io/zk-stack).

Abstract leverages advanced zero-knowledge cryptography to build a scalable blockchain that looks and feels like Ethereum, but with lower costs and higher throughput.

Abstract is EVM-compatible, which means smart contracts are written in Solidity/Vyper and can be called with the same clients as other EVM-compatible chains.

Most existing smart contracts will work out of the box with Abstract, so migrating your apps will be seamless.
