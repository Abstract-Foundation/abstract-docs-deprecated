# Setup

This tutorial will go through the steps of writing, compiling, deploying, and verifying a contract on Abstract's testnet. Similar steps can be run for contract development on Abstract mainnet.

## Installing Hardhat

For this tutorial, we will be using `hardhat`, which is currently the preferred method for contract deployment on Abstract. Foundry also works, but may have issues with contract verification.

**Make sure you are using Node 18+ for this tutorial**.

To start, initialize a new node project by running the command below and filling out the necessary details:
```bash
# For npm
npm init

# For yarn
yarn init
```

You can the follow the instructions [here](/tooling/hardhat#install-dependencies) or below to install hardhat in your working directory.

```bash
# For npm
npm i -D @matterlabs/hardhat-zksync

# For yarn
yarn add -D @matterlabs/hardhat-zksync
```

## Initializing the Project

Once hardhat is installed, you can initialize a new project by running:
```bash
# For npm
npx hardhat init

# For yarn
yarn hardhat init
```

You will then be prompted with a series of questions to properly configure hardhat. For this tutorial we will be creating a `Typescript project`.
Your output will look something like below:
```bash
888    888                      888 888               888
888    888                      888 888               888
888    888                      888 888               888
8888888888  8888b.  888d888 .d88888 88888b.   8888b.  888888
888    888     "88b 888P"  d88" 888 888 "88b     "88b 888
888    888 .d888888 888    888  888 888  888 .d888888 888
888    888 888  888 888    Y88b 888 888  888 888  888 Y88b.
888    888 "Y888888 888     "Y88888 888  888 "Y888888  "Y888

## Hardhat Config

Every hardhat project has a `hardhat.config.ts` file that defines various project settings.
Because Abstract is based on zkSync, we'll need to set some zkSync specific options in our hardhat config.

Here is a simple hardhat config that can be used to compile and deploy contracts onto Abstract (testnet).
```typescript
import { HardhatUserConfig } from "hardhat/config";
 
import "@matterlabs/hardhat-zksync";
 
const config: HardhatUserConfig = {
  zksolc: {
    version: "latest",
    settings: {},
  },
  defaultNetwork: "abstractTestnet",
  networks: {
    abstractTestnet: {
      url: "https://api.testnet.abs.xyz",
      ethNetwork: "sepolia",
      zksync: true,
      verifyURL: 'https://api-explorer-verify.testnet.abs.xyz/contract_verification',
    },
  },
  solidity: {
    version: "0.8.24",
  },
};
 
export default config;
```
