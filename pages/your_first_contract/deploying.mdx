# Deploying the Contract

Now that we've written our sample token contract, we can deploy it to Abstract so it can used.

## Deploy Script

The easiest way to deploy a contract though hardhat is to write a simple deploy script.
You will need to get the private key of your deployment wallet and add it to the script.

The script should be located at `/deploy/deploy.ts`. You may need to create a new `/deploy` directory.

**We recommend not using the private key of a real wallet that holds assets on any other chain. Use a fresh wallet specifically for deployment.**

Here's a sample script for deploying our token contract:
```typescript
import { utils, Wallet } from "zksync-ethers";
import * as ethers from "ethers";
import { HardhatRuntimeEnvironment } from "hardhat/types";
import { Deployer } from "@matterlabs/hardhat-zksync";
 
// An example of a deploy script that will deploy and call a simple contract.
export default async function (hre: HardhatRuntimeEnvironment) {
  console.log(`Running deploy script`);
 
  // Initialize the wallet.
  const wallet = new Wallet(<YOUR PRIVATE KEY>); // Replace this with your deployment wallet's private key
 
  // Create deployer object and load the artifact of the contract we want to deploy.
  const deployer = new Deployer(hre, wallet);
  // Load contract
  const artifact = await deployer.loadArtifact("SampleToken");
 
  // Deploy this contract. The returned object will be of a `Contract` type,
  // similar to the ones in `ethers`.
  const tokenContract = await deployer.deploy(artifact);
 
  // Show the contract info.
  console.log(`${artifact.contractName} was deployed to ${await tokenContract.getAddress()}`);
}
```

## Deploying

We can then run the above script to deploy the contract. You can execute the following command:
```bash
npx hardhat deploy-zksync --script deploy.ts --network abstractTestnet
```

You should see the following output in your terminal if everything executed correctly:
```bash
Running deploy script
SampleToken was deployed to CONTRACT_ADDRESS
```

You can see your deployed contract in the block explorer by taking the `CONTRACT_ADDRESS` from above and visting the following url:
`https://explorer.testnet.abs.xyz/address/CONTRACT_ADDRESS`.

## Verifying the Contract

The contract is deployed, but it cannot be viewed by anyone else because only the raw bytecode is visible to the explorer.
To make the contract readable by anyone else, we can verify the code on the explorer through zkSync's `Hardhat verify plugin`.

To start, we can install the verification plugin by running the following:
```bash
# For npm
npm i -D @matterlabs/hardhat-zksync-verify
 
# For yarn
yarn add -D @matterlabs/hardhat-zksync-verify @nomicfoundation/hardhat-verify
```

Once installed, we can verify our contract by running the verification command:
```bash
npx hardhat verify --network abstractTestnet CONTRACT_ADDRESS
```

If the command works, you should see the following output in your terminal:
```bash
Your verification ID is: <ID>
Contract successfully verified on ZKsync block explorer!
```

You can now visit `https://explorer.testnet.abs.xyz/address/CONTRACT_ADDRESS` and see your contract code fully visible!

It should look something like this:
<div style={{ display: "flex", justifyContent: "center", marginTop: 20 }}>
  <img style={{ maxWidth: "100%" }} src="/assets/verified-contract.png" />
</div>

**Congratulations, you've just written, compiled, and deployed your first contract to Abstract!**
