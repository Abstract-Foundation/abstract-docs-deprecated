# Writing the Contract

For this tutorial we will be writing a very simple ERC20 token.

## Installing OpenZeppelin

OpenZeppelin has written an open source library of common smart contracts that can be used in contract development.
These contracts are heavily audited and have been vetted by the community. You can find the source code [here](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts).

To install OpenZeppelin, run the following command:
```bash
# For npm
npm install @openzeppelin/contracts

# For yarn
yarn add @openzeppelin/contracts
```

## Contract Code

Once OpenZeppelin is installed, we can write our simple ERC20 token contract. In the `/contracts` directory, you can delete `Lock.sol` and add an empty `SampleToken.sol` file.

We'll go through the contract line by line.

First, define the license type and Solidity version at the top of the file. For our example, we'll use the MIT license and Solidity 0.8.24.

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity 0.8.24;
```

Next, we'll import OpenZeppelin's base ERC20 contract which will include most of the token logic for us.
```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity 0.8.24;

import {ERC20} from "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol";
```

From there, we'll declare our contract name and the OpenZeppelin ERC20 contract inheritance:
```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity 0.8.24;

contract SampleToken is ERC20 {}
```

Next, we'll define a constructor that will set the token's name and symbol. In this case our token has the name `SampleToken` and the symbol `SAMPLE`:
```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity 0.8.24;

import {ERC20} from "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol";

contract SampleToken is ERC20 {
    constructor() ERC20("SampleToken", "SAMPLE") {}
}
```

Finally, we'll add a `mint` function that allows anyone to mint any amount of tokens (do not do this in production):
```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity 0.8.24;

import {ERC20} from "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol";

contract SampleToken is ERC20 {
    constructor() ERC20("SampleToken", "SAMPLE") {}

    function mint(address account, uint256 amount) external {
        _mint(account, amount);
    }
}
```

## Compiling the Code

Once the code has been written, it must be compiled to ensure the code is valid and so it can be deployed later on.

To compile your code, you can run:
```bash
# For npm
npx hardhat compile --network abstractTestnet

# For yarn
yarn hardhat compile --network abstractTestnet
```

You should see an output that looks like this:
```bash
Compiling contracts for ZKsync Era with zksolc v1.5.1 and zkvm-solc v0.8.24-1.0.1
Compiling 17 Solidity files
Successfully compiled 17 Solidity files
```

**Congrats, you've now written your first contract!**
