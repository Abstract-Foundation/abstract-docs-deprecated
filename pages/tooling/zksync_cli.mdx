# Tooling

The ZKsync Command Line Interface (CLI) is a powerful tool designed to simplify the development and interaction with Abstract from a command shell.
The content on this page was forked from the [zkSync docs](https://docs.zksync.io/build/tooling/zksync-cli).

## Usage

You can run commands locally without installation using the following command: `npx zksync-cli`. For example: `npx zksync-cli dev start`.

### Install zksync-cli

You can alternatively install the CLI globally using the npm package manager:

```bash
npm install -g zksync-cli
```

If you go the route of installing the zksync-cli package locally, we recommend using the global option.

### Update zksync-cli

If you installed `zksync-cli` via the npm package manager, you can update with the following:

```bash
npm update -g zksync-cli
```

## Available Commands

- `dev`: Start a local development environment with Abstract and Ethereum nodes.
- `create`: Scaffold new projects using templates for frontend, contracts, and scripting.
- `contract`: Read and write data to Abstract contracts without building UI.
- `transaction`: Fetch and display detailed information about a specific transaction.
- `wallet`: Manage Abstract wallet assets, including transfers and balance checks.
- `bridge`: Perform deposits and withdrawals between Ethereum and Abstract.
