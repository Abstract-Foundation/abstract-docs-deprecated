# Gas fees on Abstract

## Overview

Gas fees on Abstract are computed in the same manner as gas fees on other ZK stack chains.
For a full explanation of gas costs on Abstract, you can read this [detailed breakdown](https://docs.zksync.io/zk-stack/concepts/fee-mechanism#base-fee-and-gas-limits).

## Background

Before explaining how L2 gas fees work, it's important to understand how gas fees are derived on Ethereum mainnet (L1). 
Gas fees are calculated by multiplying the total gas units used by the cost per unit of gas.

The number of gas units required is determined by the amount of computation and storage a transaction uses.
Additionally, every transaction on mainnet incurs a minimum overhead cost of [21,000 gas units](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/some-medium-term-dust-cleanup-ideas/6287#why-do-txs-cost-21000-gas-1).

The price per unit of gas is broken down into two parts: a base fee and a priority fee.
The base fee is calculated based on the current blockspace demand - the more demand, the higher the base fee.
This portion of the fee is burned by the network.
The priority fee is the amount that users are willing to pay block proposers to get their transaction included in the current block.
This portion of the fee is given to the block proposer (validator) after the transaction is executed.

Here's the formula for calculating the total gas required for an L1 transaction:
```
gas_paid = gas_units * gas_price
```
Which can be expanded out to:
```
gas_paid = (21_000 + execution_cost) * (base_fee + priority_fee)
```

## How Abstract gas fees work

L2 gas fees are computed in a different manner from L1 gas fees. L2 gas fees are broken down into two parts: L2 execution and batch overhead.

L2 execution gas is very similar to L1 execution gas. This value is determined based on the amount of compute and storage used in a transaction.
The amount of gas units consumed per transaction is similar to Ethereum mainnet because Abstract is EVM-compatible.
Unlike L1 however, the L2 portion of the gas fees are retained by the sequencer instead of being burned.

The formula for computing the L2 execution gas costs looks like this:
```
L2_execution = L2_gas_units * L2_gas_price
```

The batch overhead gas is used to cover the cost of posting transaction data back to the data availability layer (L1 or an alternative system) and for proving circuits.
Transactions are batched and sent to the DA layer to determine the final ordering of each transaction. Batching reduces costs and leads to greater throughput.
Circuit proofs are created to validate proposed L2 state transitions on the L1 validating bridge contract.

```
overhead_gas ~= L1_base_fee * txn_size (bytes) + K (constant to cover proving costs)
```

The total gas fees a user pays for a txn on Abstract can be roughly represented by this formula:
```
txn_fee = L2_execution + overhead_gas
```
