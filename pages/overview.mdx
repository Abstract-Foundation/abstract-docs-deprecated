# Abstract Overview

Abstract is an Ethereum rollup.

Rollups are a layer 2 scaling solution built on top of Ethereum.
Abstract is EVM-compatible which means you can do most things on Abstract that you would be able to do on Ethereum mainnet - deploy contracts, use Web3 apps, interact with wallets, etc.
However, because Abstract is a rollup, transactions will be cheaper and faster compared to Ethereum.
Abstract is an ZK rollup which means it inherits many security properties from Ethereum.

## How Rollups Work

The core idea behind a rollup is to move computation from one blockchain (such as Ethereum) onto another blockchain (the rollup) which can process transactions quicker.
Rollups will execute transactions, compress and bundle the transaction data, and post this data back to the underlying blockchain (the layer 1).
This data is utilized by rollup nodes to derive the correct state of the chain, as well as by the Layer 1 network to determine the validity of withdrawals.

Most rollups today have a centralized sequencer that quickly takes incoming transactions, orders the transactions, and publishes the ordering for other nodes to consume.
The sequencer can process transactions quickly, which is why transactions are faster on rollups compared to mainnet (1-2 secs vs 12 secs).
Users can alternatively submit transactions directly to the rollup bridge contract on L1 if they do not trust the sequencer.
However, this process is slower and more expensive than submitting to a sequencer, and should only be used for deposits or in the case of a malicious sequencer.

## ZK Rollup

Abstract is a zk rollup which means it uses "validity proofs" to prove to Ethereum L1 that a state transition happened on the L2.
Transactions are executed on the L2 zkEVM and aggregated into batches. The data for each batch is submitted to the L1.
A prover then creates a zero-knowledge (validity) proof of all the transactions within the batch that can be verified by a smart contract on Ethereum.
Verifying the validity of a proof is much cheaper than re-executing every L2 transaction on L1, which is why zk rollups are magnitudes cheaper than L1.
Furthermore, Abstract uses state diffs, which reduces the amount of data submitted to L1 and further reduces costs.

## Rollup Tech

Abstract is built using [ZK stack](https://docs.zksync.io/zk-stack).
ZK stack is the latest version of zkSync technology which includes a complete zk rollup system, a sequencer, token bridges, fraud proofs, and more.
Complete documentation of ZK stack can be found on [Github](https://github.com/matter-labs/zksync).

ZK Stack is EVM compatible, so most contracts that are written for mainnet can be deployed onto Abstract without any modifications.
Applications requiring read or write access to Abstract can employ the same processes used on mainnet, with the only difference being a different RPC and chain ID.
