# Bridge

A bridge is a tool that allows users to move assets such as ETH from Ethereum to Abstract and vice versa.

Under the hood, bridging works by having two smart contracts deployed:

1. A smart contract deployed to Ethereum (L1).
2. A smart contract deployed to Abstract (L2).

These smart contracts communicate with each other to facilitate the deposit and withdrawal of assets between the two chains.

## Native Bridge

Abstract has a [native bridge](https://portal.testnet.abs.xyz/bridge/) to move assets between Ethereum and Abstract for free (excluding gas fees).

Currently, the native bridge supports both ETH and ERC-20 tokens.

- Deposits from L1 to L2 take around ~15 minutes.
- Withdrawals from L2 to L1 currently take up to 24 hours due to the built-in [withdrawal delay](https://docs.zksync.io/build/resources/withdrawal-delay#withdrawal-delay).

If you require faster deposits or withdrawals, you can use [Relay](#relay) for near-instant transfers for a small fee.

## Relay

[Relay](https://testnets.relay.link/abstract) is a third-party bridge that provides near-instant transfers between Ethereum and Abstract for a small fee.

Relay works by maintaining funds on both Ethereum and Abstract and optimistically sends funds before the bridging process completes; allowing for near-instant transfers at the cost of a small fee that is paid to the relayer.

This comes with it&rsquo;s own set of risks and trust assumptions. [Learn more about Relay](https://docs.relay.link/what-is-relay).
