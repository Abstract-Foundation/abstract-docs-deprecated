# Faucets

## What is a faucet?

Faucets distribute small amounts of testnet Ether to enable developers/users to deploy and interact with contracts on testnets.
Even though testnets do not use mainnet Ether, testnet Ether is still required to pay for transaction fees.

## Sepolia Faucet

The Abstract testnet is built on top of [Sepolia](https://www.alchemy.com/overviews/sepolia-testnet) (transactions will settle to Sepolia).
In order to receive Ether on Abstract Testnet, you can either use the direct faucet or you can use a Sepolia faucet and bridge Sepolia ETH to Abstract testnet.

To get Abstract testnet ETH directly, you can use this faucet:

- [Triangle](https://faucet.triangleplatform.com/abstract/testnet)

In order to get Sepolia ETH, you can use one of the following resources:

- https://faucet.quicknode.com/arbitrum/sepolia
- https://sepoliafaucet.com/
- https://sepolia-faucet.pk910.de/

Once you've received your Sepolia Ether, you can bridge it to Abstract using our [native bridge](https://portal.testnet.abs.xyz/bridge/).
