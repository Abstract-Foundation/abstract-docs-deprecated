# Block Explorer

For our testnet, we're using zkSync's default explorer. The Abstract testnet explorer can be found [here](https://explorer.testnet.abs.xyz/).

This explorer offers tools for viewing and interacting with the network:

- View, verify, and interact with smart contract source code
- View transaction information
- View block information
- View account information
