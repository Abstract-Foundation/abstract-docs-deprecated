## How to get Ether on Abstract

**Note: These are instructions for getting Ether onto Abstract's testnet.** We will update these docs when we are closer to mainnet.

Because Abstract is a rollup, it uses **Ether** as its native currency.

In order to get Ether on Abstract, you'll have to use a bridge, or, on testnet you can follow our [faucets](/tools_integrations/faucets.md) guide.

If you'd like to use a bridge, simply go to the ["Bridge" tab on our site](https://portal.testnet.abs.xyz/bridge/).
