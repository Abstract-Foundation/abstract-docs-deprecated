# Glossary

A dictionary designed for educational purposes, providing essential terminology to support users to gain a clearer understanding through Abstract Documentation. The contents of this section were inspired by [ZKsync's Glossary](https://docs.zksync.io/build/resources/glossary) 

### Account Abstraction

Account Abstraction enhances transaction authorizations by making them programmable, offering more flexibility than Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs). This innovation aims to enrich user experiences and broaden the scope of transaction authorizations, differing from EIP-4337.

### EVM Equivalence

EVM Equivalence means that a given protocol supports every opcode of Ethereum’s EVM down to the bytecode. Thus, any EVM smart contract works with 100% assurance out of the box.

### EVM Compatible

EVM Compatible means that a large percentage of the opcodes of Ethereum’s EVM are supported; thus, a percentage of smart contracts work out of the box. Abstract is optimized to be EVM source-code compatible (with a custom compiler), not EVM equivalence.

### Layer 1

Layer 1 is the base blockchain, by defining as a foundation to any Layer 2 networks build on top of base blockchain. All user transaction activity on layer 2 will ultimately settle back to the layer 1 blockchain.

### Layer 2

Layer 2 refers to seperate blockchain networks built on top of an existing blockchain (Layer 1), These networks act as a scaling solutions to reduce the cost of entry, bringing users on-chain with lower cost of gas fee while inheriting Layer 1's security 

### Paymaster

Enabling users to pay transaction fees (Network Fees) in ERC20 tokens with innovative approach to account management significantly enhances user experience, security, and flexibility, paving the way for broader adoption of blockchain technology. 

### ZK Rollup

Known as Zero-knowledge rollups, one of the scaling solutions that increase throughput on Ethereum Mainnet by moving computation and state-storage off-chain. ZK-rollups can process thousands of transactions in a batch, act as a operator, and then only post some minimal summary data to Mainnet. This summary data defines the changes that should be made to the Ethereum state and provide validity proofs that those changes are correct.
