# Glossary

A dictionary designed for educational purposes, providing essential terminology to support users to gain a clearer understanding through Abstract Documentation. The contents of this section were inspired by [ZKsync's Glossary](https://docs.zksync.io/build/resources/glossary) 

### Account Abstraction

Account Abstraction enhances transaction authorizations by making them programmable, offering more flexibility than Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs). This innovation aims to enrich user experiences and broaden the scope of transaction authorizations, differing from EIP-4337.

### EIP-4337

Initiatively define as a Account Abstraction or Smart Wallet built via Smart Contract seperate from general web3 wallet which is alternatively known and classified as a EOA (Externally Owned Account) with a purpose of User Experience Enhancement by grouping transactions before submitting them to the network as a bundle. EIP-4337 was publicly launched by March 2024 on Ethereum Mainnet with reference from previous Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) 2938 and 3074.

### EVM Equivalent

EVM Equivalent means that a given protocol supports every opcode of Ethereum’s EVM down to the bytecode. Thus, any EVM smart contract works with 100% assurance out of the box.

### EVM Compatible

EVM Compatible means that a percentage of the opcodes of Ethereum’s EVM are supported; thus, a percentage of smart contracts work out of the box. Abstract is optimized to be EVM source-code compatible (with a custom compiler), not EVM equivalent.

### Layer 1

Layer 1 is the base blockchain, by defining as a foundation to any Layer 2 networks build on top of base blockchain. All user transaction activity on layer 2 will ultimately settle back to the layer 1 blockchain.

### Layer 2

Layer 2 refers to seperate blockchain networks built on top of an existing blockchain (Layer 1), These networks act as a scaling solutions to reduce the cost of entry, bringing users on-chain with lower cost of gas fee while inheriting Layer 1's security 

### Paymaster

Enabling users to pay transaction fees (Network Fees) in ERC20 tokens with innovative approach to account management significantly enhances user experience, security, and flexibility, paving the way for broader adoption of blockchain technology. 

### Rollups

Practically, it bundles many transactions into a single transaction via a smart contract before submitting them to Layer 1. This distributes the L1 transaction fees across everyone in the rollup, making it cheaper for each user to interact with blockchain.

### ZK Rollup

Known as Zero-knowledge rollups, one of the scaling solutions that increase throughput on Ethereum Mainnet by moving computation and state-storage off-chain. ZK-rollups can process thousands of transactions in a batch, act as a operator, and then only post some minimal summary data to Mainnet. This summary data defines the changes that should be made to the Ethereum state and provide validity proofs that those changes are correct.
